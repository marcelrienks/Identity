1. Purchase domain from registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In GitHub Pages settings, add custom domain
3. Update DNS records at your registrar:
   ```
   A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.108.153
   A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.109.153
   A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.110.153

   ```
4. Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)

## Troubleshooting

### Push Issues:
If git push fails, you may need a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use token as password when pushing

### Build Errors:
GitHub Pages should work immediately since this is a static site (no build process needed).

### 404 Errors:
- Check that branch is set to 'main' in Pages settings
- Ensure index.html is in root directory (it is)
- Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete

### Images Not Loading:
- All images are committed and should work
- Check browser console for any 404 errors
- Verify file paths are correct (they are)
