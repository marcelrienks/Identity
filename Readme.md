## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

You can deploy this project as a static website using AWS CloudFormation. A ready-to-use template is provided in `CloudFormation/s3-static-website.yaml`.

### Provisioning infrastructure with AWS CLI

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`).
2. Run the following command, replacing the parameter values as needed:

```sh
aws cloudformation deploy \
       --template-file CloudFormation/s3-static-website.yaml \
       --stack-name my-static-site \
       --parameter-overrides HostedZoneName=example.com. DomainName=example.com Subdomain=www \
       --region us-east-1
```

**Parameters:**
- `HostedZoneName` â€“ Your Route 53 hosted zone WITH trailing dot (e.g., example.com.)
- `DomainName` â€“ Your domain name WITHOUT trailing dot (e.g., example.com)
- `Subdomain` â€“ Subdomain to provision (e.g., www)
- `IndexDocument` â€“ (Optional) Defaults to `index.html`
- `ErrorDocument` â€“ (Optional) Defaults to `error.html`


**Important:**
- The stack **must be deployed in us-east-1 region** because ACM certificates for CloudFront must be in us-east-1
- The S3 bucket name is automatically set to `{Subdomain}-{DomainName}-static` (e.g., www-example.com-static)
- The template provisions an S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution with HTTPS/SSL, ACM certificate, and Route 53 DNS record
- ACM certificate is automatically created and validated via DNS
- CloudFront provides global CDN with HTTPS support and caching

### Uploading Website Files to S3

After the CloudFormation stack is created, you must upload your website files to the S3 bucket. CloudFormation does not upload files automatically.

**Steps:**
1. The S3 bucket name is automatically set to `{Subdomain}-{DomainName}-static` (e.g., www-example.com-static).
2. Use the AWS CLI to upload your files:

```sh
# Upload all static assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
aws s3 sync ./assets s3://www-example.com-static/assets

# Upload the main HTML file
aws s3 cp ./index.html s3://www-example.com-static/index.html
```

Replace `www-example.com-static` with your actual bucket name based on your subdomain and domain.

After uploading, you may need to invalidate the CloudFront cache to see changes immediately:

```sh
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

You can find the distribution ID in the CloudFormation stack outputs or AWS Console.
